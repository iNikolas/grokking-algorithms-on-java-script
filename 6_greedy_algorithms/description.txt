A greedy algorithm is simple: at each step, pick the optimal move.
In technical terms: at each step you pick the locally optimal
solution, and in the end you’re left with the globally optimal solution.
Obviously, greedy algorithms don’t always work. But they’re simple to
write!
Sometimes all you need is an algorithm that solves the problem pretty
well. And that’s where greedy algorithms shine, because they’re simple
to write and usually get pretty close.

This is called an approximation algorithm. When calculating the exact
solution will take too much time, an approximation algorithm will
work. Approximation algorithms are judged by
• How fast they are
• How close they are to the optimal solution
Greedy algorithms are a good choice because not only are they simple
to come up with, but that simplicity means they usually run fast, too.
In this case, the greedy algorithm runs in O(n^2) time, where n is the
number of radio stations.
