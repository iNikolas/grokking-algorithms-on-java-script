Breadth first search is a different kind of search algorithm: one that runs on
graphs. It can help answer two types of questions:
• Question type 1: Is there a path from node A to node B?
• Question type 2: What is the shortest path from node A to node B?
The way breadth-first search works, the search radiates out from the starting
point. So you’ll check first-degree connections before second-degree
connections.
