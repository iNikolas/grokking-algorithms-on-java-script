When you work with Dijkstra’s algorithm, each edge in the graph has a
number associated with it. These are called weights. To calculate the
shortest path in a weighted graph, use Dijkstra’s algorithm.
Dijkstra’s algorithm only works with directed acyclic graphs,
called DAGs for short. So you can’t use negative-weight edges with
Dijkstra’s algorithm. If you want to find the shortest path in a graph
that has negative-weight edges, there’s an algorithm for that! It’s
called the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
